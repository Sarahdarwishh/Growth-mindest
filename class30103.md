# Passing Functions as Props:

***What does .map() return?***

creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

***If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?***

 If you have a set of elements you need to loop upon to generate a JSX partial, you can create a loop, and then add JSX to an array or by Embedding map() in JSX

***Each list item needs a unique key***

***What is the purpose of a key?***

 to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted.

***What is the spread operator?***

JavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (â€¦) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

***List 4 things that the spread operator can do***

* Copying an array and Concatenating or combining arrays
* Using Math functions
* Using an array as arguments
* Adding an item to a list /Adding to state in React
* Combining objects
* Converting NodeList to an array

***Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays***

const arr1 = [A,B,C] 
const arr2 = [D,E,F]
const arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2] //arr3 ==> [A,B,C,D,E,F]`

***Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.***
let numberStore = [0, 1, 2];
let newNumber = 12;
numberStore = [...numberStore, newNumber];`

***Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one***
let arr1 = [0, 1, 2];
let arr2 = [3, 4, 5];

arr1 = [...arr1, ...arr2];
