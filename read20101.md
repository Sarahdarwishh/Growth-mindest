# HTML Chapter 1: “Structure”

often reflects a hierarchy of information,
  ```
<html>
<body>
 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might
 be split up into several sub-headings.</p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
 you follow the structure of what is being written.
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>

    ```

 HTML code contain of :
-Element, element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags: 
 1-Opening tag. Ex:<p>
 2-Closeing tag , has an extra forward slash in it. Ex:</p>
- The characters in the brackets indicate the tag's purpose. 
For example : P for paragraph , h1 for heading and h2 for subheading .

```

 ## Body, Head & Title :-

 1. `<body>` Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
 2. `<head>` is contains information about the page.
 3. ` <title>` anything written between it   will appear in the title bar (or tabs) at the top of the browser window.


 ## Summary

1. HTML pages are text documents.
2.  HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
3.  Tags are often referred to as elements.
4. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
5. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
6.  Attributes require a name and a value.
7. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.







### Extra Markup


There have been several versions of html since the creation of the web page .
1. HTML 4 (Released 1997) 
2. XHTML 1.0 (Released 2000) 
3. HTML5 (Released 2000)

***Comments in HTML*** :
`<!-- everything between these characters will not be visible in the user's browser  -->`

2. Why People Visit YOUR Website?
3. What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
4. What Information Your Visitors Need?
5. How Often People Will Visit Your Site?

 ***OBJECTS*** (THINGS) In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object , and each object can have its own Properties, Events and Methods

 Properties :describe characteristics of the current web page (such as the title of the page).

 Methods perform tasks associated with the document currently loaded in the browser (such as getting information from a specified element or adding new content).
 
 Event :  respond to events, such as a user clicking or tapping on an element.


 ### HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE:

1.RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE.

2.CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY.

3.USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN.
