# Images:

The HTML `< img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
 
It has two required attributes:

1. src - Specifies the path to the image.

2. alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image.

 ***Syntax***

`< img src=”url” alt=”alternatetext”>`


## It is used to specify the directory of the image, which can be:

1. The absolute URL of the image - if the image was taken from an online website

2. The Relative URL - if the image was uploaded from the device. The relative URL should be pointing to the directory of the image in the site's files.
