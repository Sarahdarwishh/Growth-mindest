# Images:
 <!-- The developers can control the size of an image using these properties in CSS:

  1. The width.
  2. height.
# 

How the developers can move an img to the left or the right or at the center ?

  using float property 

  # 
  The background-repeat property can have four values:
   
   1. Repeat : The image is repeated both horizontally and vertically .
   2. Repeat-x The image is repeated horizontally only .
   3. Repeat-y : The image is repeated vertically only.
   4. No-repeat :The image is only shown once.

#  -->

The HTML `< img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
 
It has two required attributes:

1. src - Specifies the path to the image.

2. alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image.

 ***Syntax***

`< img src=”url” alt=”alternatetext”>`


## It is used to specify the directory of the image, which can be:

1. The absolute URL of the image - if the image was taken from an online website

2. The Relative URL - if the image was uploaded from the device. The relative URL should be pointing to the directory of the image in the site's files.



<!-- 
Image formats
There are many image formats that developers can use. Websites mainly use jpeg, png, and gif images. Using the wrong format might result in the image looking not as sharp as it should be and can make the web page load slower.

JPEG - best used for images with where variation in colour and intensity is smooth, for example: natural scenes.

PNG - best used for the images with few colors or large areas of the same color. It is also used for images that need transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos.

Animated GIFs - they show several frames of an image in sequence (they are moving).

Scalable Vector Graph SVG - it is a new format used to display vector images. -->

# Color
There is there ways used to assign color values in CSS are(In fact, we took them at the previous level) :

1. Color names 
2. RGB values : `rgb(red, green, blue)`
3. HEX codes : `#RRGGBB`


 **Declarations are made up of two parts:**
 1.  the properties of the element that you want to change.
 2.  the values of those properties. 



# Text:
 It`s properties to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:


 1.  properties to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:
 * Font family.
 * Font size .
 * Font weight.
 * Font style.


 2. Properties that affect the text itself :
 * Text case.
 * Underline and strike.
 * Leading.
 * Alignment.
 * First letter or line. 
# 
 **There are two pseudo-classes that can be used for styling links:**

1. link - to set styles for links that have not yet been visited.

2. visited - to set styles for links that have been clicked on.

# 

#  The difference between JPEG , PNG and GIF:

1. JPEG : uses to format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth.

2.  PNG : uses to format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logo .

3. GIF : uses format for images that contain animations.
