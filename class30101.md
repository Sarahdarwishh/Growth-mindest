# React and Components.

## COMPONENTS.

 ### ***1. What is a component?***
 
it like function that return HTML elements and they are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.


## ***2. What are the charactistics of it ?***

1. Reusability − can be reused in different situations.
2. Replaceable − Components may be freely removed or replaced.
3. Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
4. Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
5. Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.


## 3.What are the advantages of using component ?

1. Component-Based architecture reduces the cost of development and maintenance.
2. It is reusable which means can be used to reusable components to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications.
3. It increases the reliability of the whole system via reuse.
4. It is easy to maintain and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
5. It modifies the complexity with the use of a component container and its services.

### What is Props and How to Use it in React?

1. What is props short for? “Props” is stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. 

***But the WHY IT IS IMPORTANT ?*** 

1. is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child) .
2. props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

### How are props used in React?

1. define an attribute and its value(data).
2. pass it to child component(s) by using Props.
3. render the Props Data.
