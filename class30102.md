## State and Props:

***Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?***

 the render then the componentDidMount.

 ***What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?***

 putting elements into the DOM (Mounting ).

 ***Put the following things in the order that they happen:***

1.constructor.
2.render.
3.React Updates.
4.componentDidMount.
5.componentWillUnmount.

***What does componentDidMount do?***

The componentDidMount() method allows us to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model). This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e after the component is rendered.

***What types of things can you pass in the props?***

 Any data type.

***What is the big difference between props and state?***

* props are variables passed to it by its parent component. 

* State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component.
 
 Also handling informations inside component use state if outside use props.

***When do we re-render our application?***
whenever there is a change in their state or props.
