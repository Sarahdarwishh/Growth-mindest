 # 6 Reasons for Pair Programming :

 pair programming commonly involves two roles: 

 1. The Driver: is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding,, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and of course writing code. 
 
 2. The Navigator :ses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.

**Pair programming touches on all four skills:**

1. Developers explain out loud what the code should do.
2. listen to others’ guidance.
3. read code that others have written. 
4. write code themselves.

**Why developers use Pair Programming**
1. Greater efficiency.
2. Engaged collaboration.
3. Learning from fellow students.
4. Social skills.
5. Job interview readiness.
6. Work environment readiness
