# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming :
# 
Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain .

# 

The more and more I write code, the more I learn that understanding the problem is the most critical piece to the equation. 
 
 #

**If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things :**

1. Make the problem domain easier.

2. Get better at understanding the problem domain.

# 
**NOTE:** Dividing the problem into parts helps a lot in solving it.
# 


# Object Literals:
**Objects:** group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object.
1. IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES .
2. IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS .

 - key: the object name.

 - The value of a property can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or 
even another object. The value of a method is always a function. 



# Document Object Model:
 specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 

  - it represents the document as nodes and objects

 - The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

 - The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.


 **WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE**
 Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:

1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.

2.  Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.
