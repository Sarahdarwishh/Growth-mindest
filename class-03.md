 # Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops
  
The difference between if and switch state

IF :

1. There is no need to provide an else option. 
2. it performs more slowly than switch .

switch :
1. You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match 
2. providing better performance than multiple if statements.


**Why switch is faster and better than if ?**
 
 * With a series of if statements, they are all checked even if a match has been found.
 *  If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running .
