# CSS ANIMATION

 With the CSS transform property you can use the following 2D transformation methods:

* translate.
* rotate.
* scaleY
* scale
* skewX
* skewY
* skew
* matrix 

## Transforms

*The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.*


***Transform Syntax***
The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

- 2D Rotate
- 2D Scale
- 2D Translate
- 2D Skew

The transform property includes multiple vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. 




# CSS Transitions & Animations
An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.


With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

***Example Of CSS3 TRANSITIONS THAT WILL WOW YOUR USERS***
 8 SIMPLE CSS3 TRANSITIONS

1. ***Fade in:***
Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.

2. ***Change color:***
Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them.

3. ***Grow & Shrink:***
To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding. But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge.
4. ***Rotate elements:***
CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element.
5.  ***Square to circle:***
A really popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa. With CSS, it’s a simple effect to achieve, we just transition the border-radius property.
6. ***3D shadow:***
3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design, which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces.

7. ***Swing:***
Not all elements use the transition property. We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.
8. ***Inset border:***
One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border. We can of course add a border to an element simply, but that will change the element’s position.
