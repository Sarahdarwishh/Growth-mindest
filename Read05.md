# **Expressions and operators** 
## Expressions and operators
### 1. Operators


    1. Assignment operators . Ex : x = y
    2. Comparison operators .Ex : x > y
    3. Arithmetic operators. Ex : x % 2 
    4. Bitwise operators Ex :  x & y
    5. Bitwise logical operators .
    6. Bitwise shift operators.
    7. Logical operators . Ex : x && y
    8. String operators Ex : 'Sarah'

### 2. Expressions: is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
    1. Primary expressions Ex:This.
    2. Grouping operator. (a + b) * c
    3. Left-hand-side expressions Ex:new


# **Loops and iteration**
### It help us to repeat something in easy and simple way.
  #### for statement :we used if we know how many times the code is run 
  ##### A for statement looks as follows:
  #### for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression] {statement }
  #### while statement : we used if we donâ€™t  know how many times the code is run
  ##### A while statement looks as follows:
  #### while (condition){statement}
